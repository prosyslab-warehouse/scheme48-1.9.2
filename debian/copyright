This package was debianized by Jorgen Schaefer <forcer@debian.org> on
Thu, 12 Aug 2004 15:04:56 +0200.

It was downloaded from http://www.s48.org/

Upstream Authors: Richard Kelsey and Jonathan Rees.
Upstream Maintainer: Michael Sperber.

Repackaged .orig.tar.gz:

As of version 1.8+dfsg-1, scheme48 is now distributed with a repacked
upstream tarball. This was done to remove the file emacs/cmulisp.el,
which is not DFSG-free. It has this license:

    Copyright Olin Shivers (1988).
    Please imagine a long, tedious, legalistic 5-page gnu-style copyright
    notice appearing here to the effect that you may use this code any
    way you like, as long as you don't charge money for it, remove this
    notice, or hold me liable for its results.

Attempts to contact Olin Shivers in order to request the removal of
the distribution constraint failed. emacs/cmulisp.el was never
distributed with the package, and was only ever present in the
source. Repacking the tarball by removing this file closed Debian bug
#509860.

    Distributing Autoconf Output
    ****************************

    [excerpt from autoconf documentation]

       The configuration scripts that Autoconf produces are covered by
    the GNU General Public License.  This is because they consist
    almost entirely of parts of Autoconf itself, rearranged somewhat,
    and Autoconf is distributed under the terms of the GPL.  As
    applied to Autoconf, the GPL just means that you need to
    distribute `configure.in' along with `configure'.

       Programs that use Autoconf scripts to configure themselves do
    not automatically come under the GPL.  Distributing an Autoconf
    configuration script as part of a program is considered to be
    *mere aggregation* of that work with the Autoconf script.  Such
    programs are not derivative works based on Autoconf; only their
    configuration scripts are.  We still encourage software authors to
    distribute their work under terms like those of the GPL, but doing
    so is not required to use Autoconf.

Most source files have the following copyright / license declaration.

    Copyright details
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
    The prefix/suffix and comparison routines in this code had (extremely
    distant) origins in MIT Scheme's string lib, and was substantially
    reworked by Olin Shivers (shivers@ai.mit.edu) 9/98. As such, it is
    covered by MIT Scheme's open source copyright. See below for details.

    The KMP string-search code was influenced by implementations written
    by Stephen Bevan, Brian Dehneyer and Will Fitzgerald. However, this
    version was written from scratch by myself.

    The remainder of this code was written from scratch by myself for scsh.
    The scsh copyright is a BSD-style open source copyright. See below for
    details.
